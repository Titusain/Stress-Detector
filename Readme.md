Efficient Stress Detection Techniques and the Role of EEG in Machine Learning
The increasing impact of stress on mental health highlights the necessity for efficient and trustworthy stress detection techniques. Electroencephalography (EEG) is central to stress classification within machine learning, leveraging its capacity to provide profound insights into neural activity. Recognizing the computational challenges posed by high-dimensional EEG data, this research addresses the need for feature selection across three domains: time, frequency, and time-frequency.

The study utilizes the SAM40 dataset, which encompasses diverse stress-inducing tasks of 40 participants. It systematically analyzes and compares the efficacy of three feature selection algorithms: PCA, LASSO, and correlation, in reducing feature dimensionality. Results showcase LASSOâ€™s remarkable accuracy of 95.75%, highlighting its potency in stress detection at a feature reduction ratio of 43.06%. Meanwhile, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) strikes an optimal balance between performance and feature complexity, achieving the highest accuracy of 94.40% and increasing the feature reduction ratio by 52.67% compared to LASSO.

These results offer valuable insights into the impact of feature selection on stress classification accuracy and establish PCA as a promising avenue for further exploration. Additionally, the research underlines the importance of refining feature selection strategies and encourages exploration into emerging techniques.
